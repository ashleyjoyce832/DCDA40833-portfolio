            <h2>What I Tried</h2>
            <p>I used a marketing campaign for a product idea I created called Sunsible to explore AI’s capabilities in marketing. Sunsible was a project I completed last spring at the University of Sydney and is a zero-waste, walk-in sunscreen vending machine designed for Australian public beaches. My team and I developed a full marketing plan, from product development to promotion, grounded in research on sustainability, technology, branding, and consumer behavior. I wanted to compare the work we did over an entire semester with AI-generated marketing campaigns to see how similar or different the outputs would be across multiple tools.
I explored Claude, Perplexity, Adobe Firefly, Leonardo AI, and NotebookLM because they reflect common ways AI is used in marketing and advertising, including campaign ideation, visual creation, and consumer research. With Claude and Perplexity, I asked each tool to create a full marketing campaign for Sunsible so I could compare their outputs with the campaign my team and I created without AI, particularly in terms of strategy, creativity, and sustainability. With image AI tools, I experimented with prompts to visualize an influencer campaign and the physical design of the Sunsible machine. With NotebookLM, I tested whether AI-generated consumer research could match the quality of academic research from university library databases.

            <h2>What Happened</h2>
            <p>Claude and Perplexity both produced marketing campaigns from the same prompt, but they revealed different strengths and limitations. Claude generated a highly organized campaign and introduced an idea we had not considered, such as creating an accompanying app. However, it made several assumptions, including defaulting to a U.S. market and prioritizing convenience and accessibility over personalization, sustainability, and community experience. It misunderstood the zero-waste mission by suggesting disposable items like hair nets. It leaned into a futuristic aesthetic, while our concept was intentionally vintage and surf-town inspired. The taglines Claude generated felt generic.
Perplexity showed a stronger understanding of the target audience, identifying eco-conscious consumers, beachgoers and athletes, tech-curious Gen Z and Millennials, and event spaces or resorts. I appreciated its emphasis on ocean and reef protection, which is especially relevant to Australian consumers, and its suggestion to place Sunsible at resorts, even though our focus was on public beaches and parks. However, like Claude, Perplexity adopted a tech-forward brand direction and overlooked the product’s social, community-driven aspects. Its four-step campaign plan felt overly simplified, and its “Tesla meets Aesop” design failed to reflect the vibe we were going for: vintage Volkswagen meets Summer Fridays.
The image AI tools revealed even more limitations. My initial prompt led Firefly to generate an actual Volkswagen van rather than a vending machine inspired by vintage VW aesthetics. Even after refining the prompt, the outputs lacked diversity, showed people dressed too fancy for a surf town, misrepresented how the product works by showing users rubbing in sunscreen instead of misting it on, and placed the machine directly in the middle of the beach, which would be unrealistic for operation.
Leonardo AI captured the film-like sunset aesthetic we were going for but misunderstood the machine’s function and placed it in unrealistic beach settings. It also emphasized thin bodies and sexualized female figures without being prompted, revealing bias in how influencer imagery is generated. Both image tools continued to show mostly white people, even when instructed to feature diverse individuals, which could be harmful to underrepresented groups.
NotebookLM performed better for research but still had limitations. It provided ten relevant sources and aligned closely with themes we identified through academic research, such as reef-safe SPF, influencer credibility, and online communities. However, several sources lacked clear academic credibility, some were behind paywalls, and the video summary relied on Reddit quotes, which would not be acceptable in an academic context.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>Overall, these experiments showed that AI tools are helpful for generating ideas and getting a general overview, but they often oversimplify complex concepts. Across tools, I noticed repeated assumptions about visual style, obvious ad copy, and simplified campaign timelines. Biases around race, body type, and Western consumer norms were most noticeable in the image-generation tools.</p>

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>In the future, I would use AI to look at projects from new angles and ask questions, but continue creating the core creative elements on my own, since the AI outputs were not as creative or original as my team’s work. I would use AI for brainstorming and early exploration, but avoid relying on it for final campaign deliverables. I also want to be more intentional about evaluating AI tools by understanding what data they are trained on, what assumptions they make, and whose perspectives may be missing.</p>
