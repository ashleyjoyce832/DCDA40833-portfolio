            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>The data visualization of access to clean, safe cooking fuel in Indonesia shows how there has been a significant reduction in indoor air pollution, which is a leading risk factor for deaths in poorer countries. At first glance, the graphic communicates a hopeful message that major progress has been made in improving human health outcomes through increased access to healthier cooking fuels. However, when analyzed using Edward Tufte’s concept of information “resolution,” the visualization provides a relatively low-resolution view of a complex and critical issue.
Tufte describes information resolution as how comprehensive and complete a visualization is in terms of the information it provides. This graphic shows a change in access to clean cooking fuel from the year 2000 to 2016 using only two data points and a single percentage comparison. While this makes the visualization simple and easy to understand, it limits how much information the viewer can take away. The graph shows a massive transformation from only about 5 percent of the country having clean fuel in 2000 to 58 percent in 2016, but it does not show how that change happened over time.
The important information behind this topic is attached to the associated article explaining why access to clean cooking fuel is vital to survival. In context, this graph has a much deeper meaning and provides insight into how serious this issue is for human health. Indoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest environmental health problems and contributes to many of the leading causes of death. These deaths are largely due to lack of access to clean fuels in poorer countries and are often preventable.
Indonesia launched a massive Clean Stove Initiative in 2012, making cooking healthier and more affordable for millions of people. This initiative resulted in significantly improved health outcomes and is a key reason behind the dramatic increase shown in the visualization. However, while the caption mentions this initiative, the visualization itself shows an effect without clearly explaining the cause. There is no visual marker to indicate that 2012 was a major turning point, which limits the viewer’s ability to connect the policy intervention to the outcome. <p></p>
            <h3>Additional Concern of Cherry-Picking</h3>
            <p>Another concern with the visualization is cherry-picking. By only showing two years, the graphic selectively highlights the beginning and end of the change without explaining why those specific years were chosen. Showing data across multiple years would provide a clearer picture of progress and help avoid oversimplifying the narrative. That said, the visualization does not appear to overreach or rush to conclusions, and it cites Our World in Data as its source, which is considered highly reliable.</p>

            <h3>Additional Concern Effects without Causes</h3>
            <p>The graphic provides a comprehensive overview of the issue within the specific country of Indonesia, but it does not offer a detailed inspection of the data. It is low resolution because it presents only two dates and one percentage change rather than multiple data points across time. While the colors and stove imagery help make the data visually engaging, the jump around the 2012 initiative is not clearly shown.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>If I were to redesign this visualization, I would create a line chart showing data at each year and clearly mark the shift after 2012. I would include additional data about death risk factors related to household air pollution to show why this issue is so important. I would keep the stove imagery and use red and gray tones, increasing the amount of gray as a higher percentage of the country gains access to healthy fuel sources. This would maintain the creative theme while improving clarity and informational depth.</p>
